  Exurbs: [
    'The Exurbs are populous, with 34 million people, and relatively wealthy, with a median household income of about $65,500. Though there is sprawl here, the counties’ rural attributes and their less-diverse citizenry lead the Exurbs to be pretty comfortably Republican in their presidential vote. Donald Trump won these counties by more than 17 percentage points in 2016.',
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/exurbs/',
  ],
  'African American South': [
    'These 370 counties hold large African American populations - the median is 37%. The counties have relatively small Hispanic populations – a median of about 3%. The presidential vote in these counties can be close because of their divided racial composition and the last few elections show how. In 2016, Donald Trump narrowly won in these counties, 49% to 48%. But Barack Obama, the first African American U.S. president, won them by five percentage points in 2012.',
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/african-american-south/',
  ],
  'Aging Farmlands': [
    'These counties are the oldest on average in the American Communities Project (ACP), with more than 24% over age 65, and the least diverse racial and ethnically. The Farmlands are 94% white and about 2% Hispanic. As may be expected, these counties are strongly Republican. In the last five presidential elections, they have not given less than 62% of their vote to a GOP candidate. Donald Trump won 74% of their vote in 2016.',
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/aging-farmlands/',
  ],
  'Big Cities': [
    'Diversity is the key word for this population: 48% are white, 15% are Hispanic, 16% are African American and 6% are Asian. The median household income is about $58,700 here, often with large pockets of poverty as well as pockets of wealth. The Big Cities are the most populous county type in the American Communities Project (ACP) and also the most Democratic. In 2016, Hillary Clinton captured 65% of the votes from these counties and won them by some 35 percentage points.',
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/big-cities/',
  ],
  'College Towns': [
    'Filled with college students, about 8% of the population sits between the ages of 18 and 21 — far higher than any other type. Incomes tend to lag the national average here because of the large student populations. They are also less diverse than the nation as a whole, about 82% white, 4% black and 5% Hispanic. Hillary Clinton won the vote coming out of these counties in 2012 by about four points, 48% to 44%.',
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/college-towns/',
  ],
  'Evangelical Hubs': [
    `The key distinguishing characteristic for these 372 counties is the high number of religious adherents tied to evangelical churches like the Southern Baptist Convention. They are also one of the most politically conservative types in the American Communities Project (ACP). Donald Trump won 73% of the vote from these places in 2016, beating Mitt Romney's 69% in 2012.`,

  ],
  'Graying America': [
    `Graying America is middle-income, about $47,800 annually for the median household. But, of course, a big defining factor is age. Almost a quarter of everyone in these counties is 62 years of age or older and only 19% of the population is under 18, making this one of the oldest types in the American Communities Project. The combined age factor and rural locales make Graying America solidly conservative politically. Donald Trump captured 58% of its vote in 2016, besting Mitt Romney's 56% in 2012.`,
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/graying-america/',
  ],
  'Hispanic Centers': [
    `These 161 counties are not necessarily majority Hispanic, but they are places where self-identified Hispanics make up a large part of the population, 56% on average. They are younger than other types in the American Communities Project, with almost 30% of the population under 18. The presidential vote in these places has grown increasingly divided as more of the young Hispanic population reaches voting age. Hillary Clinton narrowly won these counties by about two percentage points in 2016. That was a partisan flip from 2012, when Mitt Romney won them by less than one.`,
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/hispanic-centers/',
  ],
  'LDS Enclaves': [
    `The Enclaves are one of the least diverse types, with a population that is 87% white and .5% African American. 9% of the population identifies as Hispanic. Even though many of these counties are rural, the large Mormon population results in a younger average age than other places. Only 14% of the population is over the age of 65, compared to 16% nationally. They are reliably Republican, they had very mixed feelings about Donald Trump in 2016. He won only 48% of the vote in this community type. More than Hillary Clinton's 25%, but still historically low of the Enclaves.`,
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/lds-enclaves/',
  ],
  'Middle Suburbs': [
    `The Middle Suburbs have been slower to urbanize than the semi-urban places around them. At 85% white, they are less diverse than the Urban Suburbs and the Exurbs. They are also less wealthy, with a median household income of about $55,000. The presidential vote in them had been close in the 2000s, but Donald Trump won them big in 2016 by 13 points.  That was after they narrowly went to Barack Obama in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012.`,
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/middle-suburbs/',
  ],
  'Military Posts': [
    `These communities have a distinct demographic look and feel. Their military ties make them relatively young, only 13% of the population is 62 years of age or older. And they feature a larger African American population than average, 16%. Their connections to national defense give them solid conservative leanings. Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Military Posts in 2016, 55% to 38%. In 2012, Mitt Romney defeated Barack Obama in these counties, 56% to 42%.`,
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/military-posts/',

  'Native American Lands': [
    `The Native American Lands are heavily rural with low college education rates, only 14% have a college degree, and with the lowest “white only” population of any American Communities Project type, about 31%. They are pretty closely split politically. President Donald Trump won these counties by about five percentage points, flipping Barack Obama's five-point win in 2012.`,
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/native-american-lands/',
  ],
  'Rural Middle America': [
    `These counties have a less diverse population (91% white) than other American Communities Project types. They are also spread into less urban locales – 62% of the population lives in places the Census labels as rural. Though they tend to be made up of small towns, these places do not generally rely heavily on agriculture. In presidential politics they lean strongly rightward. President Donald Trump won these counties by about 29 percentage points in 2016, a big swing from 2012, when Mitt Romney won them by 12 points.`,
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/rural-middle-america/',
  ],
  'Urban Suburbs': [
    `They are densely populated — the average Urban Suburb has roughly 500,000 people living in it — and diverse. The population of these counties is about 58% non-Hispanic white, 11% African American and 16% Hispanic, with high incomes and many college degrees. Hillary Clinton won these counties by 19 percentage points in 2016, following similar wins for Barack Obama.`,
    'https://www.americancommunities.org/community-type/urban-suburbs/',
  ],
  'Working Class Country': [
    `Largely rural in nature, Working Class Country counties are among the least diverse places in the American Communities Project (ACP) — 95% white, 1% African American and 2% Hispanic. They also tend to have lower incomes and college education rates. Since 2000, every GOP presidential nominee has won at least 57% of the vote from these 337 counties. Donald Trump won 71% in 2016.`,
